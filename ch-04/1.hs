-- Using library functions, define a function halve :: [ a ] â†’ ([ a ], [ a ]) that splits an even-lengthed list into two halves.
-- For example:
--  > halve [1,2,3,4,5,6]
--  ([1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])

halve    :: [a] -> ([a], [a])
halve xs = splitAt halfSize xs
        where halfSize = length xs `div` 2
