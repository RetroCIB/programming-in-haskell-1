#  Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When is it feasible? Hint: two functions of the same type are equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.

## R: If two functions of the same type return equal results for the same arguments, they are probably the same.
## R: It could be feasible when they have polymorphic types. (Not sure :smiley:)
