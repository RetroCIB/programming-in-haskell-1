###  Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When is it feasible? Hint: two functions of the same type are equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.

#### R: In order to check if two functions are equal, it is required enumerating all the possible arguments and checking the output for each value. This way it is practically impossible to check functions equality.

#### R: It could be feasible when the number of possible arguments is a known number, such as functions that accepts Bool which only have two possible value.
