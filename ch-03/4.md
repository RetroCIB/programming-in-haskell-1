#  Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When is it feasible? Hint: two functions of the same type are equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.

## R: If two functions of the same type return equal results for the same arguments, they are probably the same. So there is no reason to compare the same function.
## R: There is a case when you can implement your own algorithm for some built-in function, and then you can check if they are behaving the same way using Eq.
